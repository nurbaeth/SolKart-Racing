# SolKart-Racing
SolKart Racing is a simple on-chain kart racing game built with Solidity. Players can join the race, choose their karts, and compete in a randomized race simulation directly on the blockchain. The outcome is determined by smart contract logic and pseudo-random values, ensuring transparency and fairness.
